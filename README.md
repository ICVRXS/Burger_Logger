# Burger_Logger

A full stack app to demonstrate use of both front-end and back-end tools such as MySql, Handlebars, and ORMs.

# Use

The app allows users to enter new burgers into a database and mark them as eaten. When the "devoured" property is true in the database, the targeted burger is moved to the appropriate position within the handlebars HTML layout which denotes it has been eaten.

The db schema includes a couple table items, one of which the devoured property is already set to true to demonstrate this function.

# Future Development

CSS to be configured soon.
